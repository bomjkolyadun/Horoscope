My app from App Store: https://itunes.apple.com/ua/app/id1082482851

# Notes
* I moved this app from a private Bitbucket repo
* It was written in 5 days in total
* It is not working, because the back-end does not work and exists anymore
* It's a good reference, how I used to write code at the beginning of 2016
* I hope, this repo will help potential employers to understand my code-style and avoid test exercises
* I auto-migrated the app to Swift 3
* I'll fix the crash later.
