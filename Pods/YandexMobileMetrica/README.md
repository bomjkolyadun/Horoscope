## AppStore submit notice
Starting from version 1.6.0 Yandex AppMetrica became also a tracking instrument and 
uses Apple idfa to attribute installs. Because of that during submitting your 
application to the AppStore you will be prompted with three checkboxes to state 
your intentions for idfa usage.
As Yandex AppMetrica uses idfa for attributing app installations you need to select **Attribute this app installation to a previously served 
advertisement**.
